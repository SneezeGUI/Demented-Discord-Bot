# Demented Discord Bot

Welcome to the home of Demented, a powerful, multi-faceted Discord bot designed to bring a unique blend of chaos, entertainment, and robust administration to your server. Powered by a witty and unhinged AI, Demented is more than just a utility‚Äîit's a personality.

This bot integrates cutting-edge features like a secure OAuth2 verification system, a conversational AI with long-term memory, and a full suite of moderation and entertainment commands, all built on a modern `discord.py 2.x` framework.

## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Conversational AI**: Engage in dynamic, context-aware conversations. The bot remembers facts about users, has a fluctuating mood, and can start conversations on its own when it gets bored.
*   üîí **Secure Member Verification**: A professional-grade OAuth2 system that requires new members to authorize through Discord, ensuring server safety and integrity. It automatically manages roles and handles users who deauthorize the bot.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Comprehensive Moderation**: A full suite of slash commands for server management, including `/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`, `/mute` (timeout), and `/clear`.
*   üéâ **Entertainment & Games**: A wide array of fun commands, from interactive games like `Truth or Dare` and `Would You Rather` to meme generation and simple social interactions like `/slap` and `/hug`.
*   üåê **API Integrations**: Fetches jokes, memes, and activities from various external APIs, with built-in caching for performance.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Configuration**: Server owners can configure bot behavior, including setting up verification roles, restricting channels, and enabling/disabling autonomous AI chat.

## Adding Demented to Your Server

To invite the bot to your Discord server, use the official authorization link:

- **Add Demented to Your Server**

## Setup for Server Admins

To get the most out of the bot, especially the verification system, follow these steps:

1.  **Create Roles**: In your server, create two roles: one for verified members (e.g., `@Verified`) and one for unverified members (e.g., `@Unverified`).
2.  **Configure Roles**: Use the `/config verification set-role` command to assign these roles to the bot.
    *   `/config verification set-role type:verified role:@Verified`
    *   `/config verification set-role type:unverified role:@Unverified`
3.  **Deploy Verification Panel**: Go to your designated verification channel and run `/verify setup`. This will post a persistent message with a "Verify Me" button.

Your server is now protected by the secure verification system!
